\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Emergent Behaviours}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item research on Modelling Emergent Behaviours;
	
	We performed this research, and focused on simulations of tag-based cooperation.
	
	\item evaluate research;
	
	We identified that the previous research had only been performed on graphs with random topologies.
	
	\item design an algorithm to simulate strategies of disruption;
	
	We designed software to perform the simulations presented in the papers we read, and also to look at extending the research that had already been performed.
	
	\item implement the algorithm on top of the distributed social network analysis tool;
	
	We were able to create a software simulation and use it as a platform to further extend the existing research.
	We did not create this software using the distributed social network analysis tool that was created as part of this project due to the time constraints.
	
	\item evaluate results.
	
	We were able to evaluate the results of the extensions we made to the research.
