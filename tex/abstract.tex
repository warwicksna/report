\begin{abstract}

Serious crimes such as violent protests and drug-trafficking are typically committed 
by  networks of criminals. Individual members of these networks use social media such as 
Twitter and Facebook to communicate. Law enforcement agencies can use publicly available data from these services to target criminal networks in new ways. The West Midlands police are interested in harnessing this data to find the best ways to disrupt such networks. 
We plan to develop a tool that takes a sample of graph data representing a social network 
and uses the data to model influence and information propagation, and to provide strategic disruption advice.

Existing tools have performance issues, a problem we plan to evade by distributing the 
computation amongst a cluster of machines. This will provide a scalable solution to computationally expensive algorithms. We will present the tool as web service using a SOAP interface.
