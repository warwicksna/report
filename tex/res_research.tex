\chapter{Research}

% Since we have a few distinct sections on this area, I think it's a good idea to split this into multiple smaller files as well

% \subsection{Graph Algorithms}
% \input{res_clustering}
% \input{res_influence_propagation}

% Does this classify as a graph algorithm subsubsection?
% \input{res_emergent_behaviour}
