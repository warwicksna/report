\section{Algorithms}
The algorithms which are implemented for DSNAT will be stored on the cluster for use via the web services interface.

Giraph provides a comprehensive API to implement distributed graph algorithms, because of this we do not see a need to implement a new API to act as a basis for implementing algorithms.

For algorithms which are difficult to express using Giraph and its vertex oriented design, we are able to fall back to using a Hadoop-based approach for implementation.
