\subsection{Issues}
Difficulties have been found using Giraph at most stages of development. Giraph has had substantial development during the time frame of the project, which results in changes to the API in many areas, however few changes were made to the classes which were used from the API. We have used version 0.2 of Giraph for our development, however even since choosing this version to base all our development from, more development has occurred to Giraph. We have chosen not to use a newer version of Giraph to avoid introducing any bugs into our code caused by any changes to existing features.

Another issue which we found with Giraph is the actual process of designing and implementing algorithms for the Giraph paradigm. SHOULD EXPLAIN WHAT ALGORITHMS WERE HARD
