\subsection{Community Detection}
An important aspect of social network analysis is the detection of communities within a graph.

\subsubsection{Clustering}
Within social networks, there are distinct regions of vertices with many connections passing between them, and a much smaller number connected to other vertices outside of this region. These regions are termed as \emph{clusters}.

Social networks are a prime example of this.

\subsubsection{\emph{k}-Cliques}
The term $clique$ is introduced by \citeauthor{luce49} in \cite{luce49} to describe a subgraph which consists of at least three vertices, each of which are fully connected with each other. From a social network perspective, this translates to saying that for each person in the clique, all of their friends  within the clique are friends of each other as well.

A \emph{k}-clique is defined as a clique which has size \emph{k}. A \emph{maximal clique} is a clique to which no more vertices can be added without violating the conditions of a clique, and the maximum clique is a clique within a graph which contains the largest number of vertices.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:clique} shows an example graph highlighting a 3-clique. It has one maximum clique \{2,3,4\} which is highlighted in red, and six other maximal cliques \{1,2\}, \{2,8\}, \{4,6\}, \{5,6\}, \{6,7\}, \{7,8\}.

\end{figure}

Identifying cliques, and solving problems involving cliques as been shown to be computationally hard \cite{bomze99, trusses}. Cliques are either too common, with cliques of only a few members are frequently too numerous to be helpful, or too rare, with large cliques too limiting to be of use \cite{trusses}. Also, computation of identifying cliques scales worse than any polynomial of the problem size, making the process unfeasible for large graphs \cite{trusses, bron72}.

There have been numerous generalisations of the clique construct to improve usefulness of the clique through relaxation of some of the properties of the clique. These include the \emph{n}-clique \cite{luce50}, \emph{n}-clan \cite{alba73} and \emph{n}-club \cite{mokken79}. However these new constructs do not solve the issues of identifying cliques, and remain hard to compute and produce too many results.

\subsubsection{\emph{k}-Trusses}
Following from relaxing properties of the clique, \citeauthor{trusses} in \cite{trusses} introduces a new construct called a truss. A \emph{k}-truss is a subgraph where an edge between two vertices, A and B, exists if at least \emph{k-2} other vertices are connected to both of A and B. The \emph{k}-truss has similar definitions to the clique. A maximal \emph{k}-truss is a \emph{k}-truss that is not a proprt subgraph of another \emph{k}-truss.

\label{fig:trusses}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trusses} shows an example application of \emph{k}-trusses. Figure \ref{fig:trusses}(a) shows the original graph. Figures \ref{fig:trusses}(b-f) show the \emph{k}-truss for increasing values of \emph{k}. If the same original graph were to be analysed for \emph{k}-cliques for the same values of \emph{k}, more vertices in the graph would have been removed in earlier stages, which would have lost the interesting stage where Figures \ref{fig:trusses}(c) and (d) are identical.

The \emph{k}-truss is also computable in polynomial time to the input graph, which offers a marked improvement on the computation costs of identifying cliques and similar constructs. \cite{trusses} shows that the naive algorithm  for computing maximal \emph{k}-trusses is bounded by $O(n|E|^2 + n)$, where \emph{n} is the number of vertices in the graph, and \emph{|E|} is the number of edges in the graph. A more efficient method is shown to take $O(\Sigma d^2(v))$, where \emph{d(v)} is the degree of a vertex, \emph{v}.

\subsubsection{Clustering Coefficients}
Clustering coefficients provide a way to measure the amount to which vertices within a graph cluster together.
