\section{Emergent Behaviour}

The purpose of this component of the project is to examine and
describe how networks of agents converge and cooperate, and to look at measuring the robustness of this cooperation of such
networks in the presence of infiltrators.  More specifically,
we will be looking at networks which use a tag-based approach to
cooperation based on the work done by Riolo, Cohen, Axelrod (RCA) \cite{rca}.
The infiltrators will be self-interested agents, agents
which do not follow the social norms of the network.  In our case,
these self-interested agents could be thought of as law-enforcement
individuals, who may be interested in joining such a network but not cooperate.
In general the presence of self-interested agents
have a negative affect on the cooperation within such a network \cite{aamas2008}.
We will therefore look at methods to preserve the high rates of cooperation
in these networks when self-interested agents are present.

\subsection{Existing Research}

The work will be based on a number of existing pieces of research on tag-based cooperation within a network of agents in the presence of self-interested agents.

\subsection{RCA Tag-based Cooperation}

Tag-based cooperation was introduced to observe the nature and method that cooperation in a network
emerges \cite{rca}.
The purpose of this research was to observe how cooperation can be achieved in a network where there is no direct reciprocity.

The cooperation approach described by RCA takes place in a population
of agents.  Each agent is assigned a single tag and a single tolerance
value.  Both the tag, $\tau$, and tolerance, $T$, are selected randomly from a
uniform distribution between $0$ and $1$.
The tag is a cultural artefact---a form of a public identifier.
The tolerance is used to determine the willingness of an agent to cooperate.

The approach described by RCA is generational.  Each generation is
divided into two phases: a donation phase and a reproduction phase.
The donation phase occurs first and allows every agent to perform
a number of donations.  After the donation phase the reproduction
phase allows agents to reproduce based on the relative success of each agent---more successful agents will produce a larger amount of offspring.

During the donation phase, each agent in the population is selected
to make a number of donations.  The number of donations each agent
is selected to make is known as the number of interactions pairings
per generation, $P$.  When an agent has been selected for donation
an agent is picked at random to which they have the opportunity to
donate.  In the RCA approach an agent will donate to the random
agent if the difference between the two agents' tags is less than
the tolerance of the donator, using the formula presented in \ref{fig:rca-donation-eqn}.  If an agent chooses to donate, they
will incur a small cost, $c$, and provide a benefit, $b$, to the receiving
agent.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{equation*}
    	|\tau_A - \tau_B| < T_A
	\end{equation*}
	\caption{Equation for determining if an agent will donate}
	\label{fig:rca-donation-eqn}
\end{figure}

The cooperation of a population of agents is measured by the donation rate in each generation.

Once every agent has been given an opportunity to donate $P$ times,
the reproduction phase takes place.  During the reproduction phase,
each agent reproduces in accordance with their relative success.
The most successful agents produce more offspring than the less
successful agents.  Each agent compares itself to a randomly selected agent.
If the agent is less successful than the randomly selected agent then its
offspring derives from the random agent.  If the agent is more
successful than the random agent, then its offspring derives from
itself.  The offspring takes the tag and tolerance values of the
more successful agent.  There is a small chance that the tag and
tolerance values could be mutated.  If the tag is mutated, the
offspring will receive a new tag taken randomly from the uniform
distribution $\left[0, 1\right]$.  If the tolerance is mutated, a
small amount of gaussian noise with a mean of $0$ is added to the
tolerance value.

Once the donation and reproduction phases for a given generation
have occurred, the process is repeated on the new population.

In experiments, RCA observed that the donation rate quickly stabilises after around
$100$ generations.  Occasionally, an agent gets a tolerance value
that is much smaller than the average tolerance as the result of a
mutation.  This mutation allows the agent to become more successful
as they are less likely to donate.  The impact of this reduces the
overall donation rate until the agents converge on the new tag---due
to the reproduction process---at which time the donation rate raises
and stabilises again.

By experimentation, RCA found that with a higher number of interaction
pairings in each generation, the donation rate and average tolerance
increases.  RCA also noted that when the cost of donating became
too high relative to the benefit of receiving a donation, the
donation rate dropped dramatically.  From these results, we will
choose the number of interaction pairings per generation, $P$, to
be at least $3$, the cost of donation to be $0.1$, and the benefit
of receiving a donation to be $1$.

While RCA chose to use a generational approach where every agent produces offspring,
an alternative approach based around a learning interpretation was mentioned but not implemented.

\subsection{Learning-Interpretation of Reproduction}

Hales and Edmonds (HE) applied the learning interpretation presented by RCA \cite{he}.

The learning interpretation differs from the {\emph reproduction} based interpretation of RCA
in that no offspring are not produced in the reproduction phase.
Instead, if during the reproduction phase an agent compares itself to a randomly selected agent which is more successful than itself, the agent will adopt the randomly selected agents' tag and tolerance values.
This means that the population of agents remains the same but the tag and tolerances of the agents change in each generation.
HE demonstrated that the rate of cooperation was not altered by adopting this approach.

Another change HE made was to make a tag represent the neighbourhood of the agent.
When a new tag is learnt from another agent or through mutation,
this new tag effectively causes the agent to rewire itself in a network so as to remove connections to those agents with its old tag,
and forge connections to agents that share the same new tag.
In the HE approach, donations are only permitted between agents in the same neighbourhood.
Using this interpretation, a tag could be thought of as a gang sign, and agents would only have a chance to cooperate with those agents in the same gang.

\subsection{Image Scoring}

In 2008, the notion of tag-based cooperation was altered to observe how cooperation changes in the presence of self-interested agents \cite{aamas2008}.
The basic approach of RCA was combined with the learning interpretation of HE.
In addition, all the agents were connected in a graph with a random network topology.
Agents were only able to donate to the agents to which they are connected.

This model was used to observe the effect of self-interested agents (cheaters)
on the donation rate.
In this case, a cheater is an agent that always refuses to donate to other agents, despite the tag and tolerance values.
As such a cheater is likely to be very successful, as they receive the benefits of donation without incurring the costs.
It was shown that the presence of just a small amount of cheaters in the network
caused a large reduction in the overall rates of cooperation.

In order to address this problem, an image scoring mechanism was introduced.
Every agent observes the interaction pairings of its neighbours.
Each agent keeps track of the times when a neighbouring agent chooses or refuses to make a donation.
The observations for each neighbour are stored in a queue data structure.
When an agent is selected to make a donation, they will consider the observations of their local network
when donating in addition to their tag and tolerance values.

This approach to ranking a neighbourhood is chosen due to the lack of direct reciprocity.
Direct reciprocity is when, by donating to another agent, it is likely that the other agent will in future donate to you.
In these such networks however, direct reciprocity does not occur,
it was therefore considered important to take into account the neighbourhood to which an agent belongs when they make a donation.
The choice of an agent to donate is determined by the equation \ref{fig:aamas-2008-donation-eqn}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{align*}
    T_A' = T_A + \left(T_A \times \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\delta_i}{n}\right)
\end{align*}
\caption{Equation to determine if an agent is ready to donate, augmented with neighbourhood assessment}
\label{fig:aamas-2008-donation-eqn}
\end{figure}

Until each agent has recorded enough observations,
the basic tag and tolerance approach described by RCA is used.

It was observed that using this approach,
a significant increase in the donation rate, particularly
with small percentage of cheaters, could be achieved.

\subsection{Network Rewiring}

In order to further increase cooperation in the presence of cheaters,
the ability for agents to rewire their connections was introduced \cite{aamas2010}.
This allows an agent to rewire their connections to other agents, in effect changing the neighbourhood of an agent.
The reasoning behind this was to allow an agent to drop connections to the agents in their neighbourhood which are unlikely to donate, and replace these with connections to new agents which are more likely to donate.

Each agent which learnt during the learning phase,
is given an opportunity to rewire their own connections.
At this point, each of these agents is allowed to drop any number of its
connections to other agents and then add connections to new neighbours.
The aim of this is to allow agents to remove un-cooperative agents from
their neighbourhood in order to increase cooperation in their network.

There are two parameters that are used to control the rewiring phase:
the rewire proportion and the rewire strategy.
The rewire proportion is a percentage which is used to determine the number of
neighbours removed or added during a rewiring.
When the rewire proportion is zero, then no rewiring takes place.
When the rewire proportion is one, then all of an agents connections will be dropped and replaced with new connections.
There is a single rewire proportion value for all agents, which remains constant throughout the whole simulation.

The rewiring strategies determine which of an agents' connections are dropped and which new connections are to be acquired.
In their paper, Griffiths and Luck introduced four different rewiring strategies,
these are: Random, Random Replace Worst, Individual Replace Worst and Group Replace Worst.
For the purposes of the following descriptions of these strategies,
it is assumed that each neighbour of an agent can be ranked in order of their observed past donation behaviour.
This assumption is used to allow a rewiring strategy to identify the most and least cooperative agents in an agent's network.

\begin{description}
\item[Random Rewiring Strategy]
When the random rewiring strategy is used,
each agent will drop a proportion of their connections at random.
Once an agent has dropped these connections, the agent will then add new
connections to new agents at random to replace the connections dropped.

\item[Random Replace Worst Rewiring Strategy]
In this strategy, each agent will rank their neighbouring agents in terms
of their perceived willingness to donate, based on past observations.
Based on these rankings, the rewiring agent will drop their neighbours
which have the worst donation rate track record. Once these connections have
been dropped, random connections to new neighbours will be forged---as in
the random rewiring strategy.

\item[Individual Replace Worst Rewiring Strategy]
The individual replace worst strategy will---like the random replace
worst rewire strategy---remove connections to their neighbours which have
the worst record of donations. After these connections have been dropped,
the agent will look at their most willing neighbour and replace the lost
connections with their neighbour's best ranked connections. In the case where
adding a new connection would duplicate an existing connection, or connect an
agent to itself, a random connection is added instead. The effect of this is
that the new connections are the same as the best connections of their best
neighbour.

\item[Group Replace Worst Rewiring Strategy]
The group replace worst rewiring strategy is very similar to the individual
replace worst rewiring strategy. Like the individual replace worst rewiring
strategy, the neighbouring agents with the worst donation track record are
dropped. Once these connections have been dropped, the agent will connect
to the best ranked neighbour of each of its best ranked neighbours. As in the
individual replace worst rewiring strategy, any possible duplicate connections
will instead by replace by a random new connection.

\end{description}

\subsection{Effects of Rewiring Strategy on Cooperation}

To observe the effect of these different rewiring strategies as well as the
rewire proportion on the donation rate, Griffiths and Luck performed a number
of experiments.

It was found that the random rewiring strategy performed better than the RCA
approach, but worse than the RCA approach augmented with context assessment
(Griffiths, 2008). It was found that all the other rewiring strategies resulted
in a better donation rate than either of the RCA approaches. It was found that
rewiring was poorest when the rewiring proportion was close to zero or one.
It was found that the random replace worst rewiring strategy performed poorly
when the rewiring proportion was greater than around $0.6$. It was found that
the individual and group replace worst rewiring strategies performed similarly
and had the best results when the rewire proportion was between $0.4$ and $0.8$.

From the results, it was show that by implementing these simple rewiring
strategies, it is possible to get a significant increase in overall cooperation---
in the paper, there was an increase of around 20\% over the image-scoring approach
in populations with 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% cheaters.

From these results, it appears to be sensible to choose a rewire proportion in
the range $0.4$ to $0.8$. In the paper, it was suggested to use a value of $0.6$
for the rewire proportion.
