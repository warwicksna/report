\chapter{Research}
This chapter is composed of three sections. The first concerns itself with existing research within the area of the analysis of social networks. The second . The final section is concerned with distributed computing, and how it can be used for analysing graphs of social networks.

% Since we have a few distinct sections on this area, I think it's a good idea to split this into multiple smaller files as well

\section{Social Network Analysis}
Analysis of social networks is becoming ever-increasing in importance, with the huge growth social network sites such as Facebook\footnote{\url{https://www.facebook.com/}} and Twitter\footnote{\url{http://twitter.com/}} have experienced in recent years. This research undertaken within this section relates to various metrics which can be applied to a social network to identify important people within the network, and also how the structure of the network can be identified.
