\section{Data Sets}
This section should include details about the results of running the algorithms we implemented on each of the datasets we used

\subsection{Enron}
One dataset which we needed to check the performance of DSNAT with was the Enron email network\footnote{\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html}}. This is a dataset containing nodes representing email addresses, and connections existing between the nodes if at least one email was sent between them. The dataset contains 36,692 nodes and 367,662 edges.

The SNAP website which hosts the Enron dataset provides statistics about each dataset available, including the number of triangles within the dataset (assuming the network is undirected), and the average clustering coefficient.

For the Enron dataset, SNAP lists the number of triangles existing within the network as 727,044 and the average clustering coefficient as 0.4970.

\subsubsection{3-Clique}
As stated previously, the identification of 3-cliques within a graph is also known as triangle identification. Using the triangle identification algorithm, we were able to mutate the network such that the only nodes and edges remaining within the graph were those nodes constructing at least one triangle two other nodes.

The number of triangles existing within the network is simply the sum of the values stored at all of the nodes within the network, as the node with the highest ID in the triangle contains the count of the triangle.

After summing the number of triangles, we also arrive at the same figure of 727,044 triangles present within the Enron network. Table \ref{tab:enrontriangles} shows people present in the Enron network forming the most triangles.
