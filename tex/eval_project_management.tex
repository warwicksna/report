\section{Project Management}
For a project of this size, involving multiple people, a structured approach to organising how development of the project occurred was required

\subsection{Communication}
An important aspect of any project is communication between all parties involved. For this project, this included ourselves, but also our project supervisors.

Once a week we met with our project supervisors to discuss progress made from the previous meeting, and how progress would develop during the next week. Minutes from meetings can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:minutes}.
