\subsection{Hadoop}

\subsection{Emergent Behaviour}

\subsection{SOAP}

\subsection{Influence Propagation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can use Hadoop to implement graph algorithms without Giraph/Pregel, but its tricky.
	\item Most effective to work out algorithms with pen and paper before starting to code. Much trickier than single-thread coding.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visualiser}

The main lessons and issues discovered when attempting to make a graphical user interface for a distributed system are as follows:

The first lesson is scalability:
Issues surrounding the potential use of the previous years work as the basis for the visualation component of this years project, may have been proven to be unwise. As the visualisation, while visually pleasing, does not have the scalability required to allow it function with the graphs that have been generated in this project. While the exact cause of the errors regarding the fatal crashes of the visualiser have not been explained due to uncertainty, it is clear that there is a distinct correlation between the size of the graph and the inability of the graphical processing unit on the system running the interface to generate and visualise a graph of the size we desire. As the size of graph we wish to visualise increasing in node density, the greater the strain on the graphics processing areas of the system involved.
