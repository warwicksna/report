    abstract = {{A long-standing problem in biological and social sciences is to understand the conditions required for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in evolving populations. For many situations, kin selection1 is an adequate explanation, although kin-recognition may still be a problem. Explanations of cooperation between non-kin include continuing interactions that provide a shadow of the future (that is, the expectation of an ongoing relationship) that can sustain reciprocity2, 3, 4, possibly supported by mechanisms to bias interactions such as embedding the agents in a two-dimensional space4, 5, 6 or other context-preserving networks7. Another explanation, indirect reciprocity8, applies when benevolence to one agent increases the chance of receiving help from others. Here we use computer simulations to show that cooperation can arise when agents donate to others who are sufficiently similar to themselves in some arbitrary characteristic. Such a characteristic, or 'tag', can be a marking, display, or other observable trait. Tag-based donation can lead to the emergence of cooperation among agents who have only rudimentary ability to detect environmental signals and, unlike models of direct3, 4 or indirect reciprocity9, 10, no memory of past encounters is required.}},

@article{citeulike:1648081,
    abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on the problem of maintaining significant levels of cooperation in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks of selfish adaptive peers. We propose a simple algorithm that maintains high levels of cooperation in such a network while performing the collective task of file sharing. The algorithm is adapted from novel "tag" models of cooperation that do not rely on explicit reciprocity, reputation or trust mechanisms. A sequence of three simulation models is presented-starting with an abstract model of tag-based cooperation (TagWorld) and finishing with a P2P file-sharing model (FileWorld) that puts the technique to work. From analysis of extensive computer simulations, we demonstrate the technique to be scalable, robust, and decentralized; it requires no central servers or authorities. The algorithm is relatively simple: peers do not need to store additional trust information about other nodes or to perform significant additional processing.}},
